Introduction
Welcome to ZenML!

ZenML is an extensible, open-source MLOps framework for creating portable, production-ready machine learning pipelines. By decoupling infrastructure from code, ZenML enables developers across your organization to collaborate more effectively as they develop to production.


ZenML Overview
For MLOps Platform Engineers
For Data Scientists
For ML Engineers
ZenML enables MLOps infrastructure experts to define, deploy, and manage sophisticated production environments that are easy to share with colleagues.

ZenML Pro: ZenML Pro provides a control plane that allows you to deploy a managed ZenML instance and get access to exciting new features such as CI/CD, Model Control Plane, and RBAC.


Self-hosted deployment: ZenML can be deployed on any cloud provider and provides many Terraform-based utility functions to deploy other MLOps tools or even entire MLOps stacks:

Copy
# Deploy ZenML to any cloud
zenml deploy --provider aws

# Connect cloud resources with a simple wizard
zenml stack register <STACK_NAME> --provider aws

# Deploy entire MLOps stacks at once
zenml stack deploy  --provider gcp
Standardization: With ZenML, you can standardize MLOps infrastructure and tooling across your organization. Simply register your staging and production environments as ZenML stacks and invite your colleagues to run ML workflows on them.

Copy
# Register MLOps tools and infrastructure
zenml orchestrator register kfp_orchestrator -f kubeflow

# Register your production environment
zenml stack register production --orchestrator kubeflow ...
Registering your environments as ZenML stacks also enables you to browse and explore them in a convenient user interface. Try it out at https://www.zenml.io/live-demo!

No Vendor Lock-In: Since infrastructure is decoupled from code, ZenML gives you the freedom to switch to a different tooling stack whenever it suits you. By avoiding vendor lock-in, you have the flexibility to transition between cloud providers or services, ensuring that you receive the best performance and pricing available in the market at any time.

Copy
zenml stack set gcp
python run.py  # Run your ML workflows in GCP
zenml stack set aws
python run.py  # Now your ML workflow runs in AWS
